# RSS feed reader
This is a RSS feed reader application. It uses the Google
Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as JSON object we can make
use of. It also uses the Handlebars templating library and
jQuery.

## How the application Works
There are four feeds available:
- Udacity Blog
- CSS Tricks
- HTML5 Rocks
- Linear Digressions

you can switch between the feeds from the Hamburger button on the top-left of the page, and choosing the feed you want.
